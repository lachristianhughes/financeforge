# FinanceForge

Welcome to FinanceForge, your user-friendly, customizable, and visually appealing platform for managing your finances effectively.

## Motivation

Traditional finance apps often overwhelm users with unnecessary details and present information in a confusing and complicated manner. FinanceForge aims to solve this problem by providing a user-friendly interface that allows users to see only the information they want, presented in a clear and organized way.

## Problem Statement

Existing finance apps fail to meet the needs of users by inundating them with irrelevant information and presenting data in a confusing manner. This leads to user frustration and difficulty in understanding their financial situation effectively.

## Goal

Our goal with FinanceForge is to create a more user-friendly finance app that helps users visually understand their financial information and allows them to organize it according to their preferences.
